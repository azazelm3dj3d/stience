# Stience

Stience is a containerized package & dependecy manager

Stience was created to assist developers in maintaing their projects using a Dockerized approach. The Stience is still in a very early alpha state, so expect breaking changes.

Currently, the CLI can only install packages from NPM registry.

### Usage

npm install stience
```

```bash
stience install <PackageName>
```
